          <p className='text-gray-700 mb-4'>
            We are not responsible for any transactions between you and the store. We are merely a means of connecting you with the seller and do not take responsibility for any compensation, losses, or damages caused by third parties.

            Layla Marketplace and its application are not responsible for the copyright of images sent by store owners or for the rights to any product-related information, including descriptions, explanations, or prices. These are the sole responsibility of the store owners unless a photography team from Layla is specifically contracted for the service, which will be documented in a signed work contract between both parties.

          <p className='text-gray-700 mb-4'>
            Furthermore, Layla Marketplace is not liable for any loss incurred by the store or the customer. The platform only connects two parties and has no authority to compensate either party or intervene in transactions. In cases where a store receives multiple complaints, we reserve the right to permanently ban the account from the platform.

            Layla prohibits the sale of illegal or restricted products, such as cigarettes or alcohol, and sellers are fully responsible for adhering to the legal regulations in their country. This includes ensuring that such items are not sold to anyone under the age of 18. Any individual or entity that misuses this platform will be subject to legal action.
