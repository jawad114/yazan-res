//       <p className='mb-4'>
//         We do not request credit card or other payment details over the phone. No member of our team will ask for this information. We disclaim any responsibility for personal actions or the sharing of personal information beyond what is specified on the site.
//       </p>

//       <p className='mb-4'>
//         Layla Marketplace and its application are not responsible for the copyright of images sent by store owners or for the rights to any product-related information, including descriptions, explanations, or prices.

In cases where a store receives multiple complaints, we reserve the right to permanently ban the account from the platform.

//       <p className='mb-4'>
//         We do not take responsibility for the content of advertisements from companies, stores, or individuals displayed on our site. We encourage users to verify the legitimacy of any advertisement before making a purchase. While we strive to screen advertisements for compliance with community standards, any ad that is deemed inappropriate or suspicious will be removed from the platform, especially if it receives complaints from users.
//       </p>

//       <h2 className='text-xl font-semibold mb-2'>User Registration and Data Accuracy</h2>
//       <p className='mb-4'>
//         Users are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the information they provide during registration, including phone numbers and email addresses. In case of password loss, these are the only means to recover your account. As a platform, we do not have access to your passwords or any other confidential information, making you solely responsible for securing your account.
